        OTT and video are intertwined, but they are not the same thing.
        OTT is just a different channel through which video content 
        (and related display or video advertisements) is delivered to end users.

        <b style="color:firebrick">Video:</b>   Video content can be viewed across any device, including computers,
                mobile devices, televisions, OTT devices, and more.

        <b style="color: firebrick;">OTT content:</b> Content that comes from an OTT content provider (like Sling TV).
                     OTT content can be viewed on multiple devices, including computers, mobile devices, OTT devices, and more.
        <b style="color: firebrick;">OTT devices:</b> Any device that is not desktop, laptop, or mobile but is used to consume OTT content. 
                     Examples include Smart TVs, Apple TVs, Chromecast, PlayStation, Xbox, Amazon Fire sticks, and other streaming devices.
